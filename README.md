# About Samuel Oliveira

Hi, I’m Samuel Oliveira, a cybersecurity student with a background in software development, networking, and databases. I’m passionate about understanding systems end to end, from application code to network architecture, and applying that knowledge to identify weaknesses and improve defenses.

My main interests are **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and penetration testing**, combining analytical thinking with hands-on security experimentation. I am committed to continuous learning and building the technical depth to contribute meaningfully to the security community.

## Why Cybersecurity?

I’ve always been curious about what happens behind the screen. Over time, this curiosity became a drive to protect systems and people online. My focus is on preventing attacks, safeguarding data, and promoting responsible and ethical technology use. For me, **cybersecurity is about trust, ethics, and continuous learning**.

## What Drives Me?

I’m deeply motivated by curiosity, purpose, and the desire to keep growing, technically and personally. **Technology never stops evolving, and I believe neither should we.** Every challenge is a new opportunity to learn, adapt, and improve.

## What Am I Working On?

I’m currently focused on strengthening my skills and experience in cybersecurity through both academic and hands-on learning:

- Studying for a **CTeSP in Cybersecurity** at [**ISTEC (Instituto Superior de Tecnologias Avançadas do Porto)**](https://istec-porto.pt), deepening my knowledge in network defense, vulnerability assessment, and secure systems design.  
- Taking the **arcX Cyber Threat Intelligence 101 (Free)** course to build a foundation in threat actors, the intelligence lifecycle, and security ethics.
- Building small tools and scripts to automate repetitive security and system administration tasks.  
- Exploring **DevOps security** and improving secure deployment practices, infrastructure hardening, and monitoring strategies.
