Samuel Oliveira

Cybersecurity student and curious builder. I enjoy breaking complex problems into simple steps, documenting what I learn, and turning ideas into small, useful tools. My interests sit at the intersection of security, systems, and the web.

What I’m focusing on

Security and networking foundations (protocols, monitoring, basic SOC workflows)

Practical scripting and automation (Bash, starting with Python)

Clean, accessible web interfaces and small utilities

Learning by doing: short, well‑scoped projects with clear READMEs

Skills snapshot

Security: basic network analysis (Wireshark), reconnaissance (nmap), secure habits

Programming: C++ fundamentals, Bash; learning Python

Web: HTML, CSS, JavaScript; Bootstrap

Tools: Git & GitHub, Linux
